This Object Pool Design pattern is used with Singleton design pattern and required thread safety while acquiring and releasing the resource.

Category: Creational Design Pattern
•⁠  ⁠Manages the pool of reusable objects like DBConnection object.
•⁠  ⁠Borrow from the pool - use it → then return it back to the pool.
Advantages:
•⁠  ⁠Reduce the overhead of creating and destroying the frequently required object (generally resource intensive objects)
•⁠  ⁠Reduce the latency, as it uses the pre initialized object.
•⁠  ⁠Prevent Resource exhaustion by managing the number of resource intensive object creation.
Disadvantages:
•⁠  ⁠Resource Leakage can happen, if object is not handled properly and not being returned to the pool.
•⁠  ⁠Required more memory because of managing the pool.
•⁠  ⁠Pool management required thread safety, which is additional overhead.
•⁠  ⁠Adds application complexity because of managing the pool.
